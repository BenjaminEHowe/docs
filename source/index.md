# Introduction

The Mondo API is designed to be a predictable and intuitive interface for interacting with users' accounts. We offer both a REST API and web hooks.

The API is in beta and isn't publicly-available yet. If you're interested in using it, please [get in touch](http://twitter.com/getmondo). Similarly, if a feature you'd like is missing (or broken!), do let us know.

As one of the first – if not *the* first – example of a widely-available bank API, we're very excited to see what you build!
