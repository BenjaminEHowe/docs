# Introduction

> API endpoint

```
https://mini.mondobank.io
```

The Mondo API is designed to be a predictable and intuitive interface for interacting with user's accounts. We offer both a REST API and web hooks.

The API isn't publicly-available at this time, but if you're interested in using it, please get in touch. Similarly, if a feature you'd like is missing, do let us know. As one of the first examples (if not *the* first example) of a widely-available bank API, we're very excited to see what you build!
