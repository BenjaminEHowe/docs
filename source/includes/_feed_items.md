# Feed items

The Mondo app is organised around the feed – a reverse-chronological stream of events. Transactions are one such feed item, and your application can create its own feed items to surface relevant information to the user.

It's important to keep a few principals in mind when creating feed items:

1. Feed items are *discrete* events that happen at a *point in time*.
2. Because of their prominence within the Mondo app, feed items should contain information of *high value*.
